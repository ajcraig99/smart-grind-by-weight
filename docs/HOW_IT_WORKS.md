## Algorithm details

### Grinding Algorithm

The system uses a **zero-shot learning algorithm** requiring no prior knowledge or manually tuned variables. It instantly adapts to changes in temperature, humidity, grinding coarseness, bean type, and hardware characteristics.

**Multi-Phase Approach:**

1. **Initialization & Taring Phase**
   - Automatic tare on grind button press
   - 60-second timeout from grind start to completion (30 seconds for manual grinds)
   - Noise-adaptive settling detection

2. **Grinder Saturation Phase** (Weight mode only)
   - Saturates the grinder before main grind for accurate latency detection
   - Configurable amount: 0.1g-5.0g (default 1.0g)
   - **Prime mode**: Keeps coffee, continues immediately after settling
   - **Purge mode**: Shows confirmation popup, waits for user to discard stale grinds
   - Logging and chart updates disabled during purge confirmation

3. **Predictive Phase**
   - Learns flow rate and motor-to-cup latency (relay + motor inertia + burr spin-up)
   - Predicts when to stop motor based on measured flow and coast characteristics
   - Target: barely undershoot target weight (overshoot is unrecoverable)
   - Uses runtime-configurable motor response latency (30-200ms, default 50ms)

4. **Pulse Correction Phase**
   - Conservative pulse duration calculation using 95th percentile flow rate
   - Bounded pulses respect hardware-specific motor response latency
   - Pulses range from motor latency minimum to latency + 225ms maximum
   - Mechanical instability detection (3+ sudden weight drops triggers diagnostic)
   - Repeats until target ± tolerance reached

5. **Time Mode Additional Pulses**
   - Dedicated `TIME_ADDITIONAL_PULSE` phase for post-completion grinding
   - 100ms fixed pulse duration
   - Split-button UI: OK + PULSE buttons on completion screen

**Motor Response Latency Model:**

The motor response latency represents the physical system lag between relay activation and grounds production. This value is hardware-specific and accounts for:
- Relay closure time (solid-state vs mechanical relays)
- Motor inertia (110V vs 220V motors)
- Burr spin-up characteristics (different grinder models/designs)

The latency value is automatically calibrated via **Auto-Tune Motor Response** (Menu → Tune Pulses) using binary search with statistical verification, or uses a safe 50ms default. This enables universal grinder compatibility without firmware modifications.

**Key Features:**
- Noise-resistant through multi-modal load cell measurement (instant, smoothed, filtered)
- Hardware-adaptive pulse control via runtime motor latency
- Conservative approach: undershoots target, then corrects with bounded pulses
- Mechanical instability detection with hysteresis and persistence
- 60-second grind timeout protection with user acknowledgment requirement
- Motor dead-man: a continuous run is cut off if the control loop stops
  checking in for 1 second, independently of the grind logic

## Frequently asked questions

**Will this modification work on grinders other than the Eureka Mignon Specialita?**

See the comprehensive **[Grinder Compatibility Matrix](GRINDER_COMPATIBILITY.md)** for detailed compatibility information across different grinder models, including confirmed compatible models, adaptation requirements, and installation methods.

**Can I use this to grind directly into a portafilter instead of a dosing cup?**

Yes, but requires modifications: use 1kg load cell (vs 0.3kg) for better accuracy with heavier portafilters. Design and 3D print custom portafilter holder mounting to load cell. The dosing cup holder design serves as reference for portafilter adapter.
